    "  - Histograms are primarily used to show the frequency distribution of a continuous or discrete dataset.\n",
    "  - In a histogram, all bins (buckets) are of equal size.\n",

    "    - Outlier detection\n",
    "    - Visualizing the relationship between 2 variables (ex: area vs price, height vs exam score)\n",
    "    - Identifying trend (ex: linear regression)\n",
    "  - A bubble plot (or bubble chart) is used primarily in scenarios where you want to visualize relationships among three or more numeric variables in a single chart. It extends a scatter plot by adding a third dimension through the size of the bubbles (and sometimes a fourth dimension through color).\n",
    "  - A bubble plot is best suited for exploring and communicating multivariate data relationships visually, where size and position convey important insights about three variables simultaneously."
